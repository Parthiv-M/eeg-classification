# EEG Signal Classification Workflows

As part of an effort to observe the workflow involved in the field of EEG signal classifcation, we have implemented two papers that we hope will showcase the range of differences and advancements in the data curation process, the methodologies adopted and the algorithms used. 

## About the papers

The papers we used as a basis for our study are given below.

### Primary Paper
The primary paper is titled **Classification of EEG Signals from Four Subjects During Five Mental Tasks**, and was written by **Charles W. Anderson and Zlatko Sijerˇci ́c** in **1996**. Our interpretation and implementation of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/Parthiv-M/eeg-classification/blob/e8dd387e3245513738b9137ebf5cd74b775310e2/anderson_1996).

### Secondary Paper
The secondary paper is titled **Automated classification of non-motor mental task in electroencephalogram based brain-computer interface using multivariate autoregressive model in the intrinsic mode function domain** and was written by **Suman Duttaa, Mandeep Singha, and Amod Kumar** in **2018**. Our interpretation and implementation of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/Parthiv-M/eeg-classification/blob/e8dd387e3245513738b9137ebf5cd74b775310e2/dutta_2018).

## About the dataset

We used the popular Keirn and Aunon dataset, which contains EEG data recorded by Zak Keirn at Purdue University in 1989. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/64464/?casa_token=xQHs48mqsSIAAAAA:cdzcXRExgddbXcKJAzKi1-pKmj0QuQ06Pz2ySaRa-i6bYoiWPN3UEFmp5Vg2m-ACiehEvSmnEUU). The dataset can be downloaded in a `.mat` format from [here](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/eeg/main/data/1989_Keirn_and_Aunon).
